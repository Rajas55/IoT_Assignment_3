**This Python script enables a device to connect to a Wi-Fi network, simulate sensor data for temperature, humidity, and CO2 levels, and publish the data to a ThingSpeak channel using MQTT.**

#**Features**
Wi-Fi connection using predefined SSID and password.
Generation of random sensor data:
Temperature (in Â°C)
Humidity (in %)
CO2 concentration (in ppm)
Publishing of sensor data to ThingSpeak via MQTT.
Continuous data publishing with a 10-second interval between publications.
#**Requirements**
A device capable of running Python scripts and connecting to Wi-Fi.
Network connectivity to the mqtt3.thingspeak.com MQTT broker.
#**Setup**
Ensure your device is Wi-Fi capable and has Python installed.
Replace WIFI_SSID and WIFI_PASSWORD with your actual Wi-Fi credentials.
Configure the MQTT broker details if different from the provided defaults:
MQTT Client ID
MQTT User
MQTT Password
MQTT Server (mqtt3.thingspeak.com by default)
MQTT Port (1883 by default)
Set up your ThingSpeak channel and note the channel ID and Write API Key. Update the mqtt_topic_temperature, mqtt_topic_humidity, and mqtt_topic_co2 variables with your channel's specifics.
#**Usage**
Run the script using a Python interpreter. The device will automatically connect to the Wi-Fi network and start publishing the simulated sensor data to the configured ThingSpeak channel.

#**Note**
This script uses random values for sensor data simulation and is intended for testing purposes. Replace the generate_sensor_data() function with actual sensor readings in a production environment.
